/**
 * The web + instructions AgentSkill, shared by every app.
 *
 * Each editor has its own preload bridge (`window.desktop`, `window.desktopApi`,
 * `window.slidesApi`, `window.pdfApi`), so the transport is injected rather
 * than imported — that is the only thing that differs between the four, and
 * duplicating the tool definitions four times is how they would otherwise
 * drift apart.
 *
 * Tools:
 *  - `browse_page`  render a URL in the built-in browser and read it
 *  - `extract_pages` pull several URLs as markdown via Tavily (no rendering)
 *  - `load_skill`   fetch the body of one of the user's own skills
 *  - `remember` / `forget`  the agent's own notes on how this user works
 *  - `view_page`    render the open document and look at it
 *
 * Web/image search stays in each app's existing search skill; this module adds
 * the reading half, which is what "browse the web" actually needs.

const BROWSE_PROMPT = `## Browsing
- \`browse_page\` opens a URL in the built-in browser and returns the rendered text, so it works on pages that only render with JavaScript. Use it when a search snippet is not enough and you need what the page actually says.
- \`extract_pages\` is the cheaper bulk option: it returns several URLs as markdown without rendering them. Prefer it when you already have the links and just need the text.
- Quote or cite what you read; never present a page's claims as your own knowledge.

## Memory
- \`${REMEMBER_TOOL}\` stores one short preference so it survives into later conversations. ${MEMORY_TOOL_GUIDANCE}
- \`${FORGET_TOOL}\` removes one, by its exact recorded wording. Use it when the user says a preference no longer holds.
- Anything already recorded appears under 'What you remember about this user'. Do not re-record what is listed there.

## Looking at the page
- \`${VIEW_PAGE_TOOL}\` renders the open document and returns it as an image, so you can see the layout instead of inferring it from the structure. Use it for questions about spacing, overflow, alignment and balance — and again after a layout change, to check the result rather than assuming it worked.
- Its arguments say what this app can do. With a \`page\` argument you can render any page directly; without one it captures what is on screen, so bring the page you care about into view first.
- Reading the content is still the job of the document tools; this is for judging how it looks.`
